Subject: [PATCH] PCI: aardvark: Issue PERST via GPIO
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Add support for issuing PERST via GPIO specified in 'reset-gpios'
property (as described in PCI device tree bindings).

Some buggy cards (e.g. Compex WLE900VX or WLE1216) are not detected
after reboot when PERST is not issued during driver initialization.

If bootloader already enabled link training then issuing PERST has no
effect for some buggy cards (e.g. Compex WLE900VX) and these cards are
not detected. We therefore clear the LINK_TRAINING_EN register before.

It was observed that Compex WLE900VX card needs to be in PERST reset
for at least 10ms if bootloader enabled link training.

Tested on Turris MOX.
